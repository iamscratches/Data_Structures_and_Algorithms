# 🟦 Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid

## 📜 Problem Statement

**Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-area-of-square-hole-in-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-15](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-area-of-square-hole-in-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-15)

You are given an `n × m` grid of bars.
Some **horizontal bars** and **vertical bars** are removed.

### Goal

Find the **maximum possible area of a square hole** that can be formed after removing bars.

---

## 🧠 Key Observation

A **square hole** is determined by:

* Number of **consecutive horizontal bars removed**
* Number of **consecutive vertical bars removed**

Let:

* `h = longest consecutive sequence in hBars`
* `v = longest consecutive sequence in vBars`

Then:

```
max square side = min(h + 1, v + 1)
area = side × side
```

👉 `+1` because `k` removed bars create `k + 1` gaps.

---

## 🔍 Strategy

1. **Sort** both `hBars` and `vBars`
2. Find the **longest consecutive streak**
3. Convert streak → hole width (`streak + 1`)
4. Square the **minimum of horizontal and vertical**

---

## ✨ Example

```
hBars = [2,3,4]
→ longest streak = 3
→ height = 4

vBars = [1,2]
→ longest streak = 2
→ width = 3

max square side = min(4,3) = 3
area = 9
```

---

## ✅ Code Explanation

### Main Logic

```java []
int s = Math.min(maxSpan(hBars), maxSpan(vBars));
return s * s;
```

### Consecutive Span Detection

```java
private int maxSpan(int[] bars) {
    int res = 1, streak = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < bars.length; i++) {
        if (bars[i] - bars[i - 1] == 1) streak++;
        else streak = 1;
        res = Math.max(res, streak);
    }
    return ++res;
}
```

✔ Counts longest consecutive run
✔ Converts bars → gaps using `+1`

## 🧩 Full Code (As Given)

```java []
class Solution {
    public int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m, int[] hBars, int[] vBars) {
        Arrays.sort(hBars);
        Arrays.sort(vBars);
        int s = Math.min(maxSpan(hBars), maxSpan(vBars));
        return s * s;
    }

    private int maxSpan(int[] bars) {
        int res = 1, streak = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < bars.length; i++) {
            if (bars[i] - bars[i - 1] == 1) streak++;
            else streak = 1;
            res = Math.max(res, streak);
        }
        return ++res;
    }
}
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

| Metric    | Complexity           |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| **Time**  | O(H log H + V log V) |
| **Space** | O(1)                 |

Where:

* `H` = number of horizontal bars removed
* `V` = number of vertical bars removed

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting the `+1` gap rule
❌ Using grid size `n`, `m` unnecessarily
❌ Brute force grid simulation

---

## 🧠 Interview One-Liner

> “The largest square hole is determined by the minimum of the longest consecutive removed horizontal and vertical bars, plus one.”

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

* Grid holes are about **gaps, not bars**
* Sorting + streak counting is enough
* No need to simulate the grid
* Elegant O(n log n) solution
