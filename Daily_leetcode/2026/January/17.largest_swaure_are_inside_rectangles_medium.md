# 🟩 Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles

## 📜 Problem Statement

**Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-largest-area-of-square-inside-two-rectangles/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-17](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-largest-area-of-square-inside-two-rectangles/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-17)

You are given **N axis-aligned rectangles**, defined by:

* `bl[i]` → bottom-left corner `(x₁, y₁)`
* `tr[i]` → top-right corner `(x₂, y₂)`

### Goal

Find the **maximum possible area of a square** that lies completely inside the **intersection of any two rectangles**.

* You may choose **any pair** of rectangles
* If no intersection exists → return `0`

---

## 🧠 Core Insight

A square can exist **only inside the overlapping region** of two rectangles.

So for every pair:

1. Compute their **intersection rectangle**
2. The **largest square** inside it has side:

   ```
   min(intersection width, intersection height)
   ```
3. Track the maximum such side length

---

## 🔍 Intersection Geometry

For two rectangles `i` and `j`:

```
Left   = max(bl[i].x, bl[j].x)
Right  = min(tr[i].x, tr[j].x)
Bottom = max(bl[i].y, bl[j].y)
Top    = min(tr[i].y, tr[j].y)
```

Valid overlap if:

```
Left < Right AND Bottom < Top
```

---

## 📐 Square from Intersection

```
width  = Right - Left
height = Top - Bottom
squareSide = min(width, height)
```

Area:

```
squareSide²
```

## ⚙️ Algorithm

### Steps

1. Iterate over **all pairs of rectangles**
2. Compute their intersection
3. If intersection exists:

   * Compute max square side
   * Update global maximum
4. Return square of max side

## ✅ Code (As Provided)

```java []
class Solution {
    public long largestSquareArea(int[][] bl, int[][] tr) {
        int s = 0;
        int n = bl.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int minX = Math.max(bl[i][0], bl[j][0]);
                int maxX = Math.min(tr[i][0], tr[j][0]);
                int minY = Math.max(bl[i][1], bl[j][1]);
                int maxY = Math.min(tr[i][1], tr[j][1]);

                if (minX < maxX && minY < maxY) {
                    int len = Math.min(maxX - minX, maxY - minY);
                    s = Math.max(s, len);
                }
            }
        }

        return (long) s * s;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis

| Metric    | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Time**  | O(N²)      |
| **Space** | O(1)       |

* Each rectangle pair checked once
* No extra memory used

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Input

```
bl = [[1,1],[2,2]]
tr = [[5,5],[6,6]]
```

### Intersection

```
X overlap: [2,5] → width = 3
Y overlap: [2,5] → height = 3
```

### Largest square

```
side = min(3,3) = 3
area = 9
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases

| Case                               | Result            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| No overlapping rectangles          | 0                 |
| Touching edges only                | 0                 |
| Multiple overlapping pairs         | Max among all     |
| Thin intersection (width ≠ height) | smaller dimension |

---

## 🚀 Possible Optimizations?

* ❌ Cannot asymptotically improve beyond **O(N²)**
* All rectangle pairs must be checked
* Geometry-based pruning isn’t applicable here

This solution is **already optimal**.

## 🧠 Interview Explanation (One-Liner)

> “For every rectangle pair, compute their intersection; the largest square inside it has side equal to the minimum of intersection width and height.”

## 🟢 Key Takeaways

✔ Square fits only inside intersection
✔ Geometry > simulation
✔ O(N²) is optimal here
✔ Clean and safe integer math
