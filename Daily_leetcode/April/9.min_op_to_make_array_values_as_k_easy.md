# 🔧 Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to k
## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-values-equal-to-k/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-09)

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in the array equal to `k`. Each operation consists of removing an element from the array.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 100

**Example:**
```text
Input: nums = [5,2,5,4,5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
The operations can be performed in order using valid integers 4 and then 2.
```

## 🧠 Intuition
We want to count how many operations are needed to make **all values in the array equal to `k`**. However, any value less than `k` cannot be incremented to reach `k`, hence the process is impossible in that case. The only way to ensure all values become `k` is if they are either equal to `k` or greater than `k` (and we perform reductions).

## 🏗️ Approach
1. **Track Present Numbers**:
   - Use a boolean array `hasNum[101]` to track which numbers exist in the input array `nums`.

2. **Validation and Count**:
   - Loop through numbers `1` to `100`:
     - If a number `< k` exists in `nums`, return `-1` as it's impossible to make it `k`.
     - If a number `> k` exists, count it because it needs to be reduced to `k`.

3. **Return the Count**:
   - The total count gives the minimum operations required.

### ✅ Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        boolean[] hasNum = new boolean[101];
        for(int num: nums){
            hasNum[num] = true;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < 101; i++){
            if(hasNum[i] && i < k){
                return -1;
            }
            else if(hasNum[i] && i > k){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Time Complexity
- **O(n)** — To iterate over the input array of length `n`.
- **O(1)** — The loop over 1 to 100 is constant time.

**Total:** `O(n)`

## 🗄️ Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — The `hasNum` array size is fixed (length 101).

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough

### Example 1:
```java
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 10], k = 5
```
- Number `1` and `3` are less than `k`, so return `-1`.

### Example 2:
```java
Input: nums = [5, 6, 7, 8], k = 5
```
- All numbers ≥ k
- Numbers greater than `k`: `6, 7, 8` → 3 operations needed.

```java
Output: 3
```

## 🙌 Final Thoughts
This solution efficiently checks feasibility and counts the exact number of operations needed using a simple array. It's both **time-efficient** and **space-efficient**.
