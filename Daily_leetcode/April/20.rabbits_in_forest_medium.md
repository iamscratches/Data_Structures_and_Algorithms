# 🔍 Rabbits in Forest - Frequency Counting Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-20)

In a forest, each rabbit answers with an integer indicating how many other rabbits have the same color. Given an array `answers`, return the minimum number of rabbits in the forest.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ answers.length ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ answers[i] ≤ 999

**Example:**
```text
Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Two rabbits answer "1" - they could both be red
One rabbit answers "2" - it must be blue with two other blues
Minimum total: 2 red + 3 blue = 5 rabbits
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Frequency Counting**: Tracks how many rabbits give each answer
2. **Group Calculation**: Determines complete color groups
3. **Overflow Handling**: Starts new group when current fills

Key Insights:
- Rabbits answering `x` must form groups of `x+1`
- Each full group adds `x+1` rabbits to total
- O(n) time with constant space

---

## ⚙️ Approach
### **1️⃣ Frequency Counting**
1. Count occurrences of each answer value
2. Track when group capacity is exceeded

### **2️⃣ Group Formation**
1. For each answer `x`:
   - When count reaches `x+1`, add complete group
   - Reset counter for new group

### **3️⃣ Final Count**
1. Add remaining incomplete groups
2. Sum all complete and partial groups

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java []
class Solution {
    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        int[] freq = new int[1000];  // Answers range 0-999
        int count = 0;
        
        // Process answers and count complete groups
        for (int num : answers) {
            freq[num]++;
            if (freq[num] > num) {  // Group complete
                count += num + 1;
                freq[num] = 0;  // Reset for new group
            }
        }
        
        // Count remaining incomplete groups
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                count += i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n)       | Two passes through data |
| **Space**       | O(1)       | Fixed-size frequency array |

---

## 📊 Example Walkthrough

**Input:** answers = [1,1,2]

**Execution:**
1. **First Pass**:
   - "1": freq[1]=1
   - "1": freq[1]=2 → group complete (2 rabbits)
   - "2": freq[2]=1
   - Count after pass: 2 (from first group)

2. **Second Pass**:
   - freq[2]=1 → add 3 rabbits
   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5

**Result:** 5

## 💡 Key Features
- **Group Logic**: Properly models rabbit color groups
- **Efficient Counting**: Processes data in linear time
- **Edge Handling**: Correctly counts partial groups
- **Constraint Respect**: Works within problem limits

---

## 🚀 When to Use
- Group counting problems
- When answers imply group sizes
- Problems with frequency patterns
- Minimum set calculations

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **Single rabbit**: Answer 0 means just itself
- **Uniform answers**: All rabbits same color
- **Maximum values**: Handles answer=999 correctly
- **Empty input**: Should return 0

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Alternative Data Structure**:
```java
// Use HashMap for unbounded values
```

2. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// Process frequency ranges concurrently
```

3. **Different Grouping**:
```java
// Handle more complex grouping rules
```
