# 🏋️ Maximum Task Assignment - Binary Search with Greedy Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign/description/)

Given:
- `tasks` array where tasks[i] represents difficulty
- `workers` array where workers[j] represents strength
- `pills` available that can boost a worker's strength by `strength`
- Each worker can take at most one pill
- Each worker can complete at most one task

Find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ tasks.length, workers.length ≤ 5×10⁴
- 1 ≤ pills ≤ workers.length
- 1 ≤ tasks[i], workers[j], strength ≤ 10⁹

**Example:**
```text
Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Worker 0 takes pill → strength=1 → completes task 1
Worker 1 completes task 2
Worker 2 completes task 3
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Binary Search**: To determine maximum feasible tasks
2. **Greedy Matching**: Pairs strongest workers with hardest tasks
3. **Pill Optimization**: Uses pills strategically when needed

Key Insights:
- Sort both arrays to enable efficient matching
- Binary search helps efficiently find maximum k tasks
- Deque maintains candidates for pill use
- Strongest workers handle hardest tasks first

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort tasks and workers
   - Initialize binary search bounds
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Check if mid tasks can be completed
   - Adjust search range based on feasibility
3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - Use deque to track workers who could complete tasks with pills
   - Assign strongest workers first
   - Use pills only when necessary

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        
        int left = 1, right = Math.min(tasks.length, workers.length), ans = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canAssign(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    private boolean canAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength, int k) {
        Deque<Integer> candidateWorkers = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int workerPtr = workers.length - 1;
        
        // Check from hardest to easiest task
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Add workers who could do this task with pill
            while (workerPtr >= workers.length - k && 
                   workers[workerPtr] + strength >= tasks[i]) {
                candidateWorkers.addFirst(workers[workerPtr]);
                workerPtr--;
            }
            
            if (candidateWorkers.isEmpty()) return false;
            
            if (candidateWorkers.getLast() >= tasks[i]) {
                // Worker can complete without pill
                candidateWorkers.pollLast();
            } else {
                // Need to use pill
                if (pills == 0) return false;
                pills--;
                candidateWorkers.pollFirst();
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n log n) | Sorting + Binary search with linear checks |
| **Space**       | O(n)       | Deque storage |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:** tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1

**Execution:**
1. Sort: tasks → [1,2,3], workers → [0,3,3]
2. Binary search checks k=2:
   - Task 3: Worker 3 (no pill needed)
   - Task 2: Worker 3 (no pill needed)
   - Feasible
3. Check k=3:
   - Task 3: Worker 3
   - Task 2: Worker 3
   - Task 1: Worker 0 + pill (strength=1)
   - Feasible
4. Final answer: 3

## 💡 Key Features
- **Efficiency**: Handles large input sizes
- **Optimality**: Finds maximum possible assignments
- **Flexibility**: Works with varying strengths
- **Correctness**: Handles all edge cases

## 🚀 When to Use
- Resource allocation problems
- Task assignment with constraints
- When binary search can bound the solution
- Problems with similar matching requirements

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **All workers too weak**: Returns 0
- **No pills available**: Regular matching only
- **Single task/worker**: Simple assignment
- **Large strength boost**: May enable many tasks

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Different Boost Rules**:
```java
// Variable strength boosts per worker
```

2. **Multiple Pills**:
```java
// Workers can take multiple pills
```

3. **Task Dependencies**:
```java
// Tasks have prerequisite relationships
```

4. **Worker Teams**:
```java
// Multiple workers per task
```

5. **Dynamic Tasks**:
```java
// Tasks arrive over time
```

6. **Cost Optimization**:
```java
// Minimize pill usage while maximizing tasks
```
