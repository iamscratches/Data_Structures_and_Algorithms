# üî§ Longest Alternating Subsequence - Greedy Approach

## üìú Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/description/)

Given two arrays `words` and `groups` of equal length, find the longest subsequence where no two adjacent elements have the same group value. Return this subsequence as a list of words.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ‚â§ words.length ‚â§ 100
- 1 ‚â§ words[i].length ‚â§ 10
- 0 ‚â§ groups[i] ‚â§ 1
- words contains only lowercase English letters

**Example:**
```text
Input: words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,0,1,0]
Output: ["a","b","c","d"]
Explanation: The entire sequence already alternates groups
```

## üß† Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Greedy Selection**: Always takes the first valid element
2. **Single Pass**: Processes the array once
3. **Adjacency Check**: Compares current and previous groups

Key Insights:
- The first element is always included
- Subsequent elements are included only if their group differs from the previous selection
- This approach guarantees the longest possible valid subsequence

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the first word in the result
2. **Iteration**:
   - Compare each element's group with the last included element
   - Add to result if groups differ
3. **Result**:
   - Return the collected subsequence

## ‚úÖ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> getLongestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (words.length == 0) return result;
        
        result.add(words[0]);
        int lastGroup = groups[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (groups[i] != lastGroup) {
                result.add(words[i]);
                lastGroup = groups[i];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n)       | Single pass through array |
| **Space**       | O(n)       | Storage for result (worst case) |

## üìä Example Walkthrough
**Input:** 
```
words = ["a","b","c","d"], 
groups = [1,0,1,0]
```

**Execution:**
1. Start with ["a"] (group 1)
2. Add "b" (group 0 ‚â† 1)
3. Add "c" (group 1 ‚â† 0)
4. Add "d" (group 0 ‚â† 1)
5. Final result: ["a","b","c","d"]

## üí° Key Features
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward implementation
- **Efficiency**: Optimal O(n) time
- **Correctness**: Guarantees longest subsequence
- **Readability**: Clear logic flow

## üöÄ When to Use
- Alternating sequence problems
- When longest possible valid sequence is needed
- Problems requiring single-pass solutions
- Simple pattern recognition tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases
- **Single Element**: Returns just that element
- **All Same Group**: Returns first element only
- **Empty Input**: Returns empty list
- **Maximum Length**: Handles 100 elements

## üõ† Variations
1. **Track Indices**:
```java
// Return indices instead of words
```

2. **Different Group Count**:
```java
// Handle more than 2 group values
```

3. **Minimum Length**:
```java
// Find shortest valid subsequence
```

4. **Consecutive Elements**:
```java
// Require k elements between same groups
```

5. **Weighted Selection**:
```java
// Choose based on word length/weight
```

6. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// For very large arrays
```

## Alternative Implementation (Functional Style)
```java
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> getLongestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        if (words.length == 0) return List.of();
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(words[0]);
        
        IntStream.range(1, words.length)
            .filter(i -> groups[i] != groups[i-1])
            .forEach(i -> result.add(words[i]));
            
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Mathematical Proof
The greedy approach works because:
1. Including the first element is always optimal
2. At each step, selecting the first valid element doesn't preclude longer subsequences
3. The solution maintains the invariant that the sequence alternates groups

This ensures no longer valid subsequence exists that could be formed by skipping earlier elements in favor of later ones.
