# 🗓️ Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II - Dynamic Programming with Memoization Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-08)

Given:
- An array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayᵢ, endDayᵢ, valueᵢ]`
- An integer `k` representing maximum number of events you can attend

Find:
The maximum sum of values from attending at most `k` non-overlapping events, where:
1. You can only attend one event at a time
2. Events cannot overlap (next must start after previous ends)

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ k ≤ events.length ≤ 10⁶
- 1 ≤ startDayᵢ < endDayᵢ ≤ 10⁹
- 1 ≤ valueᵢ ≤ 10⁶

**Example:**
```text
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
Choose event [1,2,4] (value 4) and [3,4,3] (value 3)
Total value = 4 + 3 = 7
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Memoizes subproblem solutions
2. **Memoization**: Stores computed results to avoid recomputation
3. **Recursive DFS**: Explores attend/skip decisions
4. **Sorting**: Processes events in chronological order

Key Insights:
- Optimal substructure: Solution depends on previous choices
- Overlapping subproblems: Same subproblems recur
- Event sorting enables efficient non-overlapping checks

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Sort Events**: By start day for chronological processing
2. **Initialize DP Table**: `dp[count][index]` stores max value
3. **Recursive DFS**:
   - Base case: No more events or reached attendance limit
   - Skip case: Event overlaps with last attended
   - Attend case: Take event value and move to next non-overlapping
4. **Memoization**: Store results to avoid recomputation

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dp;
    
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {
        // Sort events by start day
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int n = events.length;
        
        // Initialize DP table with -1 (uncomputed)
        dp = new int[k + 1][n];
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }
        
        return dfs(0, 0, -1, events, k);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int curIndex, int count, int prevEnd, int[][] events, int k) {
        // Base case: no more events or attended enough
        if (curIndex == events.length || count == k) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Skip if current event overlaps with previous
        if (prevEnd >= events[curIndex][0]) {
            return dfs(curIndex + 1, count, prevEnd, events, k);
        }
        
        // Return memoized result if available
        if (dp[count][curIndex] != -1) {
            return dp[count][curIndex];
        }
        
        // Choose max between skipping or attending current event
        int maxVal = Math.max(
            dfs(curIndex + 1, count, prevEnd, events, k), // Skip
            dfs(curIndex + 1, count + 1, events[curIndex][1], events, k) + events[curIndex][2] // Attend
        );
        
        // Memoize result
        dp[count][curIndex] = maxVal;
        return maxVal;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(nk)      | n events × k possible counts |
| **Space**       | O(nk)      | DP table storage |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:** events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2

**Execution:**
1. Sort: [[1,2,4],[2,3,1],[3,4,3]]
2. DFS calls:
   - Attend [1,2,4] → DFS for next non-overlapping
   - Skip [1,2,4] → consider [2,3,1]
3. Max value path:
   - [1,2,4] (4) + [3,4,3] (3) = 7
4. DP table stores intermediate results

## 💡 Key Features
- **Optimal Substructure**: Breaks problem into smaller subproblems
- **Memoization**: Avoids recomputation of subproblems
- **Chronological Processing**: Sorted events enable efficient checks
- **Flexible Attendance Limit**: Handles arbitrary k values

## 🚀 When to Use
- Interval scheduling with values
- Problems with attendance/selection limits
- When events have associated values/weights
- Situations requiring non-overlapping intervals

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **k = 0**: Returns 0 (no events can be attended)
- **Single Event**: Returns its value if k ≥ 1
- **All Overlapping**: Can only attend one event
- **Large k**: Effectively becomes "attend as many as possible"

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Iterative DP**:
```java
// Bottom-up dynamic programming approach
```

2. **Binary Search Optimization**:
```java
// Faster next-event lookup using binary search
```

3. **Space Optimization**:
```java
// Reduce DP table to 1D array
```

4. **Value-Only Tracking**:
```java
// Track only values without indices
```

5. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// Divide events for concurrent processing
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- Dynamic programming principles
- Recursive decomposition
- Optimal substructure property
- Memoization for efficiency

## Alternative Implementation (Iterative DP with Binary Search)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        int n = events.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int count = 1; count <= k; count++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int prev = binarySearch(events, events[i][0]);
                dp[count][i + 1] = Math.max(dp[count][i], dp[count - 1][prev + 1] + events[i][2]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n];
    }
    
    private int binarySearch(int[][] events, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = events.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (events[mid][1] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
}
```
Note: This iterative version with binary search runs in O(n log n + nk) time and may be more efficient for large inputs, though the recursive solution is often more intuitive.
