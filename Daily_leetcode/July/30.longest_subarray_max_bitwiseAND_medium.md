# 🔍 Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND - Sliding Window Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-30)

Given:
- An integer array `nums`

Find:
The length of the longest subarray where the bitwise AND of all its elements is maximum among all possible subarrays.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁶

**Example:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Maximum AND is 3 (from subarrays [3,3] and [3])
- The longest subarray with AND=3 is [3,3] with length 2
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Maximum Identification**: First finds the maximum value in the array
2. **Sliding Window**: Scans for consecutive maximum values
3. **Length Tracking**: Keeps count of the longest consecutive sequence

Key Insights:
- The maximum possible AND is simply the maximum element in the array
- Only subarrays containing this maximum can produce the maximum AND
- The longest such subarray is the longest consecutive sequence of the maximum value

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Find Maximum Value**:
   - Single pass through the array to identify the maximum
2. **Scan for Consecutive Maximums**:
   - Second pass to find the longest sequence of the maximum value
3. **Return Result**: Length of the longest consecutive maximum sequence

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        // Step 1: Find the maximum value in the array
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int num : nums) {
            max = Math.max(num, max);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Find the longest consecutive sequence of max value
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == max) {
                currentLength++;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            } else {
                currentLength = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n)       | Two linear passes through the array |
| **Space**       | O(1)       | Constant extra space |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]

**Execution:**
1. Find maximum value:
   - max = 3 (from elements at indices 2,3)
2. Scan for consecutive 3s:
   - Sequence at indices 2-3: length 2
   - Single 3 at index 2: length 1
3. Return longest length: 2

## 💡 Key Features
- **Efficient Maximum Search**: Single pass to find max
- **Sliding Window**: Simple consecutive sequence detection
- **Optimal Performance**: Linear time complexity
- **Minimal Space**: No additional data structures needed

## 🚀 When to Use
- Problems involving bitwise AND operations
- When maximum value determines the solution
- Finding longest consecutive sequences
- Large input size constraints

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **All Identical Elements**: Returns array length
- **Single Element**: Returns 1
- **Multiple Maximums**: Finds longest consecutive sequence
- **All Zeros**: Returns length of zero sequence

## 🛠 Variations
1. **One-Pass Solution**:
```java
// Combine max finding and sequence scanning
```

2. **Bitmask Approach**:
```java
// Track bit positions for more complex AND operations
```

3. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// Divide array for concurrent max finding
```

4. **Early Termination**:
```java
// Stop if current max can't be exceeded
```

5. **Visualization**:
```java
// Print max sequences for debugging
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- Bitwise AND properties (result ≤ min operands)
- The fact that maximum AND equals the array maximum
- Consecutive sequence detection
- Linear scanning efficiency

## Alternative Implementation (One-Pass)
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > max) {
                max = num;
                maxLength = currentLength = 1;
            } else if (num == max) {
                currentLength++;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            } else {
                currentLength = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
Note: This one-pass version combines max finding and sequence scanning, potentially more efficient but slightly less readable. The original two-pass solution is clearer for understanding.
