# 🗓️ Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended - Greedy Approach with Priority Queue

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-07)

Given:
- An array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayᵢ, endDayᵢ]`

Find:
The maximum number of events you can attend, where:
1. You can only attend one event per day
2. An event can be attended on any day between `startDayᵢ` and `endDayᵢ` (inclusive)

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ events.length ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ startDayᵢ ≤ endDayᵢ ≤ 10⁵

**Example:**
```text
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Day 1: Attend event [1,2]
Day 2: Attend event [2,3]
Day 3: Attend event [3,4]
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Always attend the event ending soonest
2. **Priority Queue**: Tracks available events by end day
3. **Day Simulation**: Processes events day-by-day

Key Insights:
- Sorting events by start day enables chronological processing
- Prioritizing earlier-ending events maximizes future opportunities
- Skipping expired events maintains queue relevance

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Sort Events**: By start day to process chronologically
2. **Initialize Structures**: Priority queue for end days, day counter
3. **Process Events**:
   - For each day, add all available events starting that day
   - Attend the event ending soonest
   - Remove expired events from consideration
4. **Termination**: When no more events can be attended

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        // Sort events by start day
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int day = 0, index = 0, result = 0;
        int n = events.length;
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty() || index < n) {
            // If no events available, jump to next event's start day
            if (pq.isEmpty()) {
                day = events[index][0];
            }
            
            // Add all events starting on current day
            while (index < n && events[index][0] <= day) {
                pq.offer(events[index][1]);
                index++;
            }
            
            // Attend the event ending soonest
            pq.poll();
            result++;
            day++;
            
            // Remove expired events
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() < day) {
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n log n) | Sorting + heap operations |
| **Space**       | O(n)       | Priority queue storage |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:** events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

**Execution:**
1. Sort: Already sorted [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
2. Day 1:
   - Add [1,2] to pq (end days: [2])
   - Attend event ending at 2
   - result=1, day=2
3. Day 2:
   - Add [2,3] to pq (end days: [2,3])
   - Attend event ending at 2
   - result=2, day=3
   - Remove expired event (2 < 3)
4. Day 3:
   - Add [3,4] to pq (end days: [3,4])
   - Attend event ending at 3
   - result=3, day=4
5. Termination: No more events
6. Return 3

## 💡 Key Features
- **Greedy Selection**: Always picks optimal event
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Processes events in O(n log n) time
- **Day Simulation**: Handles overlapping events properly
- **Heap Management**: Maintains relevant events only

## 🚀 When to Use
- Interval scheduling problems
- When earliest deadline strategy is optimal
- Problems requiring maximum resource utilization
- Situations with time-based constraints

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **Single Event**: Returns 1
- **All Overlapping**: Chooses one per day
- **Large Inputs**: Handles 10⁵ events efficiently
- **Same Start/End**: Single-day events

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Alternative Sorting**:
```java
// Sort by end day instead for different strategy
```

2. **Calendar Visualization**:
```java
// Print scheduling decisions
```

3. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// For distributed event processing
```

4. **Weighted Events**:
```java
// Maximize value instead of count
```

5. **Room Allocation**:
```java
// Track multiple simultaneous events
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- Greedy algorithm optimality for interval scheduling
- Priority queue properties for efficient min-extraction
- Time progression simulation
- Invariant maintenance (only relevant events in queue)

## Alternative Implementation (Without Heap)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        boolean[] attended = new boolean[100001];
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int[] event : events) {
            for (int day = event[0]; day <= event[1]; day++) {
                if (!attended[day]) {
                    attended[day] = true;
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
Note: This array-based approach has O(n*d) time complexity (d = max duration) and works better for constrained day ranges. The heap solution is more efficient for larger input ranges.
