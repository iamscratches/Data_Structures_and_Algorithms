# 📈 Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array - Difference Analysis Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-10-30)

Given:
- A target array `target`
- Initial array starts with all zeros
- Operation: Choose any subarray and increment each element by 1

Find:
- The **minimum number of operations** needed to transform the initial zeros array into the target array

**Operations:**
- You can only increment subarrays (contiguous segments)
- Each operation adds 1 to all elements in the chosen subarray
- Goal: Achieve exactly `target[i]` at each position i

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= target[i] <= 10^5`

**Example:**
```text
Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3

Explanation:
One optimal sequence:
1. Increment entire array: [1,1,1,1,1]
2. Increment subarray [1,3]: [1,2,2,2,1]  
3. Increment subarray [2,2]: [1,2,3,2,1]
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Difference Analysis**: Compare adjacent elements to find required operations
2. **Greedy Approach**: Process array from left to right
3. **Cumulative Sum**: Track total operations needed
4. **Peak Detection**: Operations needed when values increase

Key Insights:
- Each time we encounter an increase, we need additional operations
- Decreases don't require extra operations (can be handled by previous increments)
- The first element determines the base number of operations
- Total operations = sum of all "uphill" changes

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Initialize**: Start with operations = first element (need to build from 0)
2. **Process Array**:
   - For each position, compare with previous element
   - If current > previous, add the difference to operations
   - If current ≤ previous, no additional operations needed
3. **Return Result**: Total accumulated operations

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int n = target.length;
        int operations = target[0];  // Need to build first element from 0
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // If current element is greater than previous,
            // we need additional operations for the difference
            if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
                operations += target[i] - target[i - 1];
            }
            // If current <= previous, no additional operations needed
            // (can be achieved by extending/shortening previous increments)
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n)       | Single pass through the array |
| **Space**       | O(1)       | Only a few variables |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:** target = [1,2,3,2,1]

**Processing:**
1. **Initialize**: operations = target[0] = 1
2. **i=1**: target[1]=2 > target[0]=1 → add (2-1)=1 → operations=2
3. **i=2**: target[2]=3 > target[1]=2 → add (3-2)=1 → operations=3  
4. **i=3**: target[3]=2 ≤ target[2]=3 → no addition → operations=3
5. **i=4**: target[4]=1 ≤ target[3]=2 → no addition → operations=3

**Output:** 3 ✓

**Visualization:**
```
Target: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Diffs:  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  (only positive differences)
Operations = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
```

## 💡 Key Features
- **Efficient**: Linear time complexity
- **Simple Logic**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Optimal Solution**: Guarantees minimum operations
- **No Extra Space**: Constant memory usage

## 🚀 When to Use
- Array transformation problems
- When operations affect contiguous segments
- Problems involving differences between adjacent elements
- Cumulative sum and difference analysis

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **All zeros**: 0 operations needed
- **All same values**: operations = first element
- **Strictly increasing**: operations = last element
- **Strictly decreasing**: operations = first element
- **Single element**: operations = that element

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Stack-based Approach**:
```java
// Use stack to track peaks and valleys
```

2. **Divide and Conquer**:
```java
// Recursively find minimum operations
```

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
```java
// DP with state tracking
```

## Alternative Implementation (More Explicit)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int operations = 0;
        int currentHeight = 0;
        
        for (int value : target) {
            if (value > currentHeight) {
                // Need to increase from current height to target value
                operations += value - currentHeight;
            }
            // Update current height (can only decrease or stay same in operations)
            currentHeight = value;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- **Difference Calculus**: Operations = sum of positive first differences
- **Monotonicity**: Only uphill segments require new operations
- **Optimal Substructure**: Minimum operations for prefix determines operations for entire array
- **Greedy Choice**: Always handle increases immediately

**Key Formula:**
```
operations = target[0] + Σ max(0, target[i] - target[i-1]) for i=1 to n-1
```

**Why This Works:**
- Think of the target array as a landscape
- Each "uphill" segment requires new operations to build the additional height
- "Downhill" segments can be achieved by not extending previous operations
- The first element requires operations to build from 0

## Proof of Correctness
Consider the cumulative effect:
1. **Base**: Need `target[0]` operations to reach first element
2. **Inductive Step**: For each subsequent position:
   - If `target[i] > target[i-1]`: Need additional `target[i] - target[i-1]` operations
   - If `target[i] ≤ target[i-1]`: Can achieve by modifying previous operations

This matches the optimal strategy of always operating on the largest possible subarray that needs incrementing.

The algorithm elegantly solves the problem by recognizing that the minimum operations is simply the sum of all positive differences between consecutive elements, providing an optimal solution with exceptional efficiency.
