# üîÅ Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times - BFS with Pruning Approach

## üìú Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-06-27)

Given:
- A string `s`
- An integer `k`

Find:
The longest subsequence of `s` that:
1. Can be obtained by deleting some characters without changing order
2. Appears as a subsequence at least `k` times in `s`
3. Is lexicographically largest among candidates of same length

**Constraints:**
- 2 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 2000
- 2 ‚â§ s.length ‚â§ 2000
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters

**Example:**
```text
Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
Output: "let"
Explanation:
Subsequence "let" appears twice:
1. l(1)e(3)t(4)
2. l(6)e(7)t(8)
Longer subsequences don't repeat twice
```

## üß† Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores candidate subsequences level by level
2. **Pruning**: Only extends valid candidates that appear ‚â•k times
3. **Lexicographical Order**: Checks candidates from 'a' to 'z' to ensure largest result

Key Insights:
- Longer valid subsequences are built from shorter ones
- Each level of BFS represents subsequences of fixed length
- The last valid candidate found will be the lexicographically largest

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
1. **Initialize BFS**: Start with empty string
2. **Level-wise Expansion**:
   - For each candidate, try appending 'a'-'z'
   - Verify if new candidate appears ‚â•k times
3. **Track Result**: Keep the longest valid candidate found
4. **Termination**: When queue is empty (no more candidates to check)

## ‚úÖ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(String s, int k) {
        String result = "";
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(""); // Start with empty string
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String current = queue.poll();
                // Try appending each character in order
                for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                    String candidate = current + ch;
                    if (isRepeatedKTimes(candidate, s, k)) {
                        result = candidate; // Update longest valid
                        queue.offer(candidate);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isRepeatedKTimes(String sub, String s, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int subIndex = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == sub.charAt(subIndex)) {
                subIndex++;
                if (subIndex == sub.length()) {
                    count++;
                    subIndex = 0;
                    if (count == k) return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(26^L * n) | L=length of result, n=s.length |
| **Space**       | O(26^L)    | Queue storage for candidates |

## üìä Example Walkthrough
**Input:** s = "letsleetcode", k = 2

**Execution:**
1. Start with ""
2. Level 1: Try "a"-"z" ‚Üí "l","e","t","s" valid
3. Level 2: Build "le","lt","ls","et","es","ts" ‚Üí "let" valid
4. Level 3: Try longer than "let" ‚Üí none valid
5. Return "let" (longest valid)

## üí° Key Features
- **BFS Progression**: Builds candidates level by level
- **Early Validation**: Checks candidates immediately
- **Lexicographical Order**: Naturally finds largest result
- **Pruning**: Only extends valid candidates

## üöÄ When to Use
- Subsequence counting problems
- When multiple occurrences are required
- Problems needing lexicographical order
- Situations with length optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases
- **k=1**: Entire string is valid
- **All Same Character**: Single character repeated
- **No Valid Subsequence**: Return empty string
- **Max Constraints**: Handles 2000 length efficiently

## üõ† Variations
1. **Memoization**:
```java
// Cache validation results
```

2. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// Validate candidates concurrently
```

3. **Visualization**:
```java
// Show candidate generation
```

4. **Early Termination**:
```java
// Stop when longer candidates impossible
```

5. **Enhanced Validation**:
```java
// More efficient subsequence counting
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- BFS properties for level-wise search
- Subsequence counting algorithm
- Lexicographical ordering
- Pruning of invalid candidates

## Alternative Implementation (Binary Search + Rolling Hash)
```java
// More complex but potentially faster for very large inputs
// Uses binary search on possible lengths and rolling hash for validation
```
Note: This alternative would be more efficient for extremely large inputs but is significantly more complex to implement. The BFS approach is preferred for its clarity and reasonable performance within the given constraints.
