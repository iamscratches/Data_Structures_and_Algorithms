# ‚úÇÔ∏è Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special - Frequency Analysis Approach

## üìú Problem Statement
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-06-21)

Given:
- A string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters
- An integer `k` (maximum allowed frequency difference)

Find:
The minimum number of deletions required to make the string "k-special":
1. All character frequencies must differ by at most `k`
2. Can delete any characters from the string

**Constraints:**
- 1 ‚â§ word.length ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

**Example:**
```text
Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation:
Original frequencies: a=4, b=2, c=1
To make all frequencies equal (k=0):
Option 1: Delete 2 'a's ‚Üí all counts=2
Option 2: Delete 1 'b' and 1 'c' ‚Üí all counts=1
Minimum deletions: 2
```

## üß† Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Frequency Counting**: Tracks how often each character appears
2. **Target Frequency Selection**: Tests possible target frequencies
3. **Deletion Calculation**: Computes deletions needed for each target

Key Insights:
- Optimal solution depends on selecting a target frequency
- Need to consider all possible target frequencies
- Can optimize by focusing on existing frequencies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
1. **Count Frequencies**: Create frequency array
2. **Check Trivial Case**: If already k-special, return 0
3. **Test Targets**:
   - For each existing frequency as target
   - Calculate deletions needed to make other frequencies within ¬±k
4. **Return Minimum**: Lowest deletion count across all targets

## ‚úÖ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String word, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        List<Integer> frequencies = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0) frequencies.add(f);
        }
        Collections.sort(frequencies);
        
        int minDeletions = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int target : frequencies) {
            int deletions = 0;
            for (int f : frequencies) {
                if (f < target) {
                    deletions += f;
                } else if (f > target + k) {
                    deletions += f - (target + k);
                }
            }
            minDeletions = Math.min(minDeletions, deletions);
        }
        
        return minDeletions;
    }
}
```

## ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n + m¬≤)  | n=word length, m=unique characters (‚â§26) |
| **Space**       | O(1)       | Fixed-size frequency array |

## üìä Example Walkthrough
**Input:** word = "aabcaba", k = 0

**Execution:**
1. Frequencies: a=4, b=2, c=1 ‚Üí [1,2,4]
2. Test target=1:
   - Delete 2-1=1 from b, 4-1=3 from a ‚Üí total=4
3. Test target=2:
   - Delete 1 from c, 4-2=2 from a ‚Üí total=3
4. Test target=4:
   - Delete 1 from c, 2 from b ‚Üí total=3
5. Minimum deletions: 2 (when target=2: delete 1b+1c=2)

## üí° Key Features
- **Efficient Frequency Handling**: Counts in O(n) time
- **Target Optimization**: Tests only relevant frequencies
- **Early Termination**: Returns immediately if already valid
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Checks all possible targets

## üöÄ When to Use
- Frequency-based string problems
- When character counts need balancing
- Problems with allowed difference constraints
- Situations requiring minimal modifications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases
- **k=0**: All frequencies must be equal
- **Empty String**: Returns 0
- **Single Character**: Already valid
- **Large k**: May require no deletions

## üõ† Variations
1. **Alternative Data Structures**:
```java
// Use HashMap for frequency counting
```

2. **Parallel Processing**:
```java
// Process targets concurrently
```

3. **Visualization**:
```java
// Show frequency distribution
```

4. **Progressive Deletion**:
```java
// Simulate actual deletions
```

5. **Enhanced Reporting**:
```java
// Return which characters to delete
```

## Mathematical Insight
The solution leverages:
- Frequency distribution properties
- Optimal target selection
- Simple arithmetic for deletion counting
- Bounded difference constraints

## Alternative Implementation (Optimized Target Selection)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String word, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) freq[c-'a']++;
        
        Arrays.sort(freq);
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Only need to check frequencies in the array as possible targets
        for (int i = 25; i >= 0 && freq[i] > 0; i--) {
            int target = freq[i];
            int deletions = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if (freq[j] == 0) continue;
                if (freq[j] < target) deletions += freq[j];
                else if (freq[j] > target + k) deletions += freq[j] - (target + k);
            }
            min = Math.min(min, deletions);
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
Note: This version optimizes by sorting frequencies and only checking non-zero frequencies as potential targets, reducing the number of iterations needed.
