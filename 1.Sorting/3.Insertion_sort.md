# 🚀 Insertion Sort - Algorithm Breakdown

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [GFG Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insertion-sort/0)

Given an array `arr[]` of size `N`, sort it in ascending order using **Insertion Sort**. The task is to implement the insertion sort algorithm that sorts the array in-place (without using extra space).

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5

**Example:**
```text
Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
```

## 🧠 Intuition
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to how you might sort playing cards in your hand:
- Maintain a **sorted subarray** that grows with each iteration
- Take one element from the unsorted part and find its correct position in the sorted part
- Shift elements to make space and insert the current element

---

## ⚙️ Approach
### **1️⃣ Iterate Through the Array**
- Start from the second element (index 1)
- Consider the first element as already sorted

### **2️⃣ Compare and Shift**
- For each current element, compare it with elements in the sorted subarray
- Shift all larger elements one position to the right

### **3️⃣ Insert Current Element**
- Place the current element in its correct position
- Repeat until the entire array is sorted

## 📐 Mathematical Derivation
### **1. Comparison Count Analysis**
Let `C(n)` be the number of comparisons needed to sort an array of size `n`:

- **Best Case** (Already sorted):  
  `C(n) = n-1`  
  Each element only compares with its immediate predecessor

- **Worst Case** (Reverse sorted):  
  `C(n) = ∑(i=1 to n-1) i = n(n-1)/2 ≈ O(n²)`  
  Each new element must compare with all sorted elements

- **Average Case**:  
  `C(n) ≈ n²/4 ≈ O(n²)`  
  On average, each insertion requires comparing half the sorted subarray

### **2. Shift Operations**
Each comparison that evaluates true requires one shift:
- **Total shifts** = Total comparisons in worst case → O(n²)
- **Space per shift** = O(1) (single element movement)

### **3. Recurrence Relation**
The algorithm can be expressed recursively:
```
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)
```
Solving via substitution method:
```
T(n) = T(n-2) + O(n-1) + O(n)
     = ...
     = O(1) + O(2) + ... + O(n)
     = O(n²)
```

### **4. Inversion Count**
Runtime is directly proportional to number of inversions (pairs where i < j but arr[i] > arr[j]):
- **Maximum inversions** = n(n-1)/2 → O(n²) complexity
- **Already sorted** = 0 inversions → O(n) time

## ✅ Code Implementation
```java []
class Solution {
    public void insertionSort(int arr[]) {
        int len = arr.length;
        for(int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;
            
            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key
               to one position ahead of their current position */
            while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j--;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }
}
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
### **Time Complexity:**
| Case          | Complexity  | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Worst**     | O(n²)       | Array is reverse sorted |
| **Best**      | O(n)        | Array is already sorted |
| **Average**   | O(n²)       | Randomly ordered array |

### **Space Complexity: O(1)**
- In-place sorting algorithm
- Uses constant extra space

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input Array:** `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`

**Execution Steps:**
1. Pass 1 (i=1): Insert 11 → [11, 12, 13, 5, 6] (1 comparison)
2. Pass 2 (i=2): 13 in place → [11, 12, 13, 5, 6] (1 comparison)
3. Pass 3 (i=3): Insert 5 → [5, 11, 12, 13, 6] (3 comparisons + shifts)
4. Pass 4 (i=4): Insert 6 → [5, 6, 11, 12, 13] (3 comparisons + shifts)

**Total Comparisons:** 8  
**Total Shifts:** 6
