# 🔍 Merge Overlapping Intervals - Sorting Approach

## 📜 Problem Statement
**Link:** [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals--170633/1?page=2&company=Google&sortBy=latest)

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals and return the non-overlapping intervals in sorted order.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ interval[i][0] ≤ interval[i][1] ≤ 10⁹

**Example:**
```text
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap → merged to [1,6]
```

## 🧠 Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Sorting**: Arranges intervals by start time
2. **Linear Scan**: Merges adjacent intervals
3. **Greedy Merging**: Combines when overlaps detected

Key Insights:
- Sorting enables sequential comparison
- Only need to compare with last merged interval
- O(n log n) time (from sorting) with O(n) space

## ⚙️ Approach
### **1️⃣ Initialization**
1. Handle edge cases (empty/single interval)
2. Sort intervals by start time

### **2️⃣ Interval Merging**
1. Initialize with first interval
2. For each subsequent interval:
   - Merge if overlaps with current
   - Else add current to result and update current

### **3️⃣ Finalization**
1. Add last merged interval
2. Return merged list

## ✅ Optimized Solution
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<int[]> mergeOverlap(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.length < 2) {
            return intervals == null ? new ArrayList<>() : Arrays.asList(intervals);
        }
        
        // Sort intervals by start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] current = intervals[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] <= current[1]) {
                // Merge overlapping intervals
                current[1] = Math.max(current[1], intervals[i][1]);
            } else {
                merged.add(current);
                current = intervals[i];
            }
        }
        merged.add(current);
        
        return merged;
    }
}
```

Key Features:
- **Early Termination**: Handles small inputs immediately
- **Clean Sorting**: Lambda comparator for clarity
- **Efficient Merging**: Single pass after sorting
- **Mutable Current**: Avoids creating new arrays

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n log n) | Dominated by sorting |
| **Space**       | O(n)       | Storage for merged intervals |

## 📊 Example Walkthrough

**Input:** [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

**Execution:**
1. **After Sorting**: Already sorted
2. **Initialize**: current = [1,3]
3. **Compare [2,6]**:
   - 2 ≤ 3 → merge to [1,6]
4. **Compare [8,10]**:
   - 8 > 6 → add [1,6], current = [8,10]
5. **Compare [15,18]**:
   - 15 > 10 → add [8,10], current = [15,18]
6. **Final Add**: [15,18]

**Result:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

## 💡 Key Features
- **Complete Merging**: Handles all overlap cases
- **Stable Sorting**: Ensures consistent results
- **Minimal Comparisons**: Only checks adjacent intervals
- **Clear Output**: Returns non-overlapping intervals

## 🚀 When to Use
- Interval scheduling problems
- Calendar merging applications
- When overlap detection is needed
- Resource allocation scenarios

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
- **Empty input**: Returns empty list
- **Single interval**: Returns as-is
- **Complete overlap**: Merges into single interval
- **Large intervals**: Handles max constraints

## 🛠 Variations
1. **Different Sort Order**:
```java
// Sort by end time if needed
```

2. **Custom Overlap Rules**:
```java
// Modify overlap condition (e.g., minimum gap)
```

3. **Interval Counting**:
```java
// Return count instead of merged intervals
```
