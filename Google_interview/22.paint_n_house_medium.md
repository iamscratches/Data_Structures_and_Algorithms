# üîç Distinct Coloring Problem - Dynamic Programming Approach

## üìú Problem Statement
**Link:** [GeeksforGeeks Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/distinct-coloring--170645/1?page=2&company=Google&sortBy=latest)

Given N houses in a row, each house can be painted with one of three colors (red, green, or blue) with different costs for each house. Find the minimum total cost to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ r[i], g[i], b[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å¥

**Example:**
```text
Input: N=3, r=[1,1,1], g=[2,2,2], b=[3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: Optimal coloring is Red(1), Green(2), Red(1) ‚Üí Total=4
```

## üß† Intuition
The solution uses:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Stores minimum costs for ending with each color
2. **Backward Induction**: Computes from last house to first
3. **Adjacency Constraint**: Ensures no two consecutive same colors

Key Insights:
- DP state tracks minimum cost ending with each color
- Current choice depends only on previous house's color
- O(n) time and O(1) space (optimized from O(n) space)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Base Case Initialization**
1. For last house, costs are just the color's own cost

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Backward Propagation**
1. For each house from N-2 to 0:
   - Cost if red = red cost + min(green or blue of next house)
   - Similarly for green and blue

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Result Extraction**
1. Minimum of the three possible starting colors

## ‚úÖ Optimized Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public static long distinctColoring(int N, int[] r, int[] g, int[] b) {
        if (N == 1) {
            return Math.min(r[0], Math.min(g[0], b[0]));
        }
        
        // DP arrays for current and next house
        long redCost = r[N-1];
        long greenCost = g[N-1];
        long blueCost = b[N-1];
        
        for (int i = N-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            long newRed = r[i] + Math.min(greenCost, blueCost);
            long newGreen = g[i] + Math.min(blueCost, redCost);
            long newBlue = b[i] + Math.min(redCost, greenCost);
            
            // Update for next iteration
            redCost = newRed;
            greenCost = newGreen;
            blueCost = newBlue;
        }
        
        return Math.min(redCost, Math.min(greenCost, blueCost));
    }
}
```

## ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis
| Metric          | Complexity | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time**        | O(n)       | Single pass through houses |
| **Space**       | O(1)       | Constant space with variables |

## üìä Example Walkthrough

**Input:** N=3, r=[1,1,1], g=[2,2,2], b=[3,3,3]

**Execution:**
1. **Initialize last house**:
   - redCost=1, greenCost=2, blueCost=3
2. **House 1 (i=1)**:
   - newRed=1+min(2,3)=3
   - newGreen=2+min(3,1)=3
   - newBlue=3+min(1,2)=4
3. **House 0 (i=0)**:
   - newRed=1+min(3,4)=4
   - newGreen=2+min(4,3)=5
   - newBlue=3+min(3,3)=6
4. **Result**: min(4,5,6)=4

## üí° Key Features
- **Optimal Substructure**: Builds solution from subproblems
- **Constraint Handling**: Enforces adjacent color difference
- **Efficiency**: Linear time for large N
- **Generalizable**: Can extend to more colors

---

## üöÄ When to Use
- Sequential decision problems
- Constrained optimization
- Problems with dependency on previous choice
- Resource allocation with restrictions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases
- **Single house**: Return minimum color cost
- **Uniform costs**: Still maintains constraints
- **Large N**: Handles within time limits
- **Extreme values**: Processes max constraints

## üõ† Variations
1. **K Colors**:
```java
// Extend to arbitrary number of colors
```

2. **Circular Arrangement**:
```java
// First and last houses must also differ
```

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
```java
// Track which colors were chosen
```
